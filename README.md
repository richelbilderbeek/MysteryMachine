# MysteryMachine

MysteryMachine is a project about a machine with a certain function, which is kept a mystery on purpose.

There are multiple types of MysteryMachines:

 * MysteryMachine: the original
 * MysteryMachineDual: has two push buttons and two toggle buttons instead of one of each. This was chosen so to facilitate a fitting casing around it
